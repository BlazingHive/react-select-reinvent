# react-select-reinvent

The purpose of this repository is to learn from the open source project: [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/tree/react-select%405.7.3)

By copying everything from the release version `react-select@5.7.3`, I'm adding my own comment for my understandings on those pieces of code.

The final purpose of this project is to contribute to project `react-select` after totally understaing every single piece of code.
